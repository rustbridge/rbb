# During the Event

## Teacher/Volunteer training

If you haven't had a volunteer training on a separate day, consider inviting all
of your volunteers an hour/half an hour early to go over some important points
and to maybe go through the curriculum with them.

## Nice things to have

- Wifi details publicly visible
- The workshop hashtag so people can tweet about it if they want
- Directions to the bathrooms
- Food should be prepared and put out if you're serving breakfast

## Check-in

Check-in can be done through Bridge Troll. You might want to hand out name tags.
It's useful to have volunteers do this so you're free for other things.

## During the opening

Be sure to tell people specific info about the area where you're hosting, how to get
home, etc.
