# Further Questions

It's unlikely that this document will ever reflect everything that goes into a
RustBridge event, so if you have questions, we'll do our best to help you out.

If you need help from the RustBridge team, we're in the #rustbridge Rust Discord
channel, as well as on GitHub. In doubt, just open a new issue on [rustbridge/team](https://github.com/rustbridge/team).

If you need help regarding spreading the word, finding a venue, or finding other
interested people in your area, the Community Team can probably help you with
that. They're on the #community-team Discord channel as well as at
[community@rust-lang.org](mailto:community@rust-lang.org) via email.
