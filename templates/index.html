    RustBridge is a workshop focused on getting underrepresented people with a
    background in another programming language to learn Rust and join the
    community.

  <h2 class="mt5 f2 lh-title">About RustBridge</h2>
  <p class="f4 lh-copy">
    RustBridge workshops are held all around the world, and specifically
    targeted towards underrepresented groups in technology. The first RustBridge
    workshop was held at
    <a href="https://2016.rustfest.eu">RustFest Berlin</a>, and since then, itâ€™s
    become a tradition of sorts to hold a workshop at every Rust conference
    thereafter. Independently, RustBridge workshops have been held in 5
    continents.
